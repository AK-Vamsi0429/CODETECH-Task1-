üîç Project Overview: Basic ALU Design
This project involves the design and verification of a Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU is a fundamental component of a CPU, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU designed in this project supports five core operations:

Addition

Subtraction

AND

OR

NOT

The ALU accepts two 4-bit input operands (A and B) and performs the selected operation based on a 3-bit control signal (ALU_Sel). The result is output on a 4-bit line (ALU_Out), and for arithmetic operations, an optional CarryOut bit is provided.

üîß Key Deliverables
Verilog Code
Implements a parameterized ALU module with conditional logic using a case statement to select the operation based on the ALU_Sel input.

Testbench
A Verilog testbench (tb_alu.v) was created to validate each ALU operation by applying test vectors and monitoring the output using $monitor.

Simulation
Functional simulation was performed using a Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado). The simulation verifies the correctness of each operation and outputs results in a time-stamped waveform or text log format.

‚úÖ Results Summary
Each ALU operation was simulated successfully. Outputs matched expected results for all tested input combinations. The simulation confirms correct functionality of the arithmetic and logic units.
